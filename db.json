The videos that you add to each problem are so helpful and I have never seen anything as useful as SystemsExpert when it comes to onsite interview prep. For about 8 years I struggled to move from an SDET/QA role to a true Software Dev role. I had tons of opportunities but almost always choked. Finally I started getting better at algorithms and I'd occasionally get to an onsite. However, once there my lack of experience with systems would show up and I would falter and leave without an offer (I also usually messed up an algorithm somewhere along the way too). AlgoExpert/SystemsExpert changed all of that for me. I finally was able to secure a software developer role and six months later, I got an offer from my dream company, Amazon. I am so excited to start building there and I owe so much of my newfound success to what I learned on this product."

When I finally landed 2 job offers (1 from Apple, 1 from Bloomberg), I 1000% percent credit this service. It is by far the service I have come to love over the years. I've recommended this service and will continue to recommend AlgoExpert / SystemsExpert to anyone I know preparing for their coding interviews (w/ the code CLEM for a discount on the platform ;)) Even though I have an amazing job now, I'll still be a loyal customer for years to come!!!"

For reasons parked for another day's discussion üôÇ, my Amazon journey didn't go as per my expectations. Thus I switched job again in August 2021 and joined Uber Bangalore as Sr Software Engineer II. In other words within 6 months I had 2 job switches in 2 of the reputed Tech giants. And guess what? I attribute 80-90% of my tech interview preparation credit to the awesome platform you guys have created. \"Powered by AlgoExpert\", I feel like cracking interviews is not that of a big deal now üòâ which gives me the choice to pick and choose the job that I like the most! Thank you once again - as I said it was a long due one. Keep doing the great work!"

I really liked the interview format that he used for tackling the problem so I figured I'd try SystemsExpert, which also uses that style. One of the things that I really got out of it was conveying confidence and using a very collaborative style while answering these questions. This tool was a big part of my successful interview prep and I'm very grateful to Clement and his team for creating this. Thanks guys!"

Thank you so much for creating such a great content and helping us to accelerate our SWE journey. I highly recommend SystemsExpert for anyone planning to land on FAANG and similar companies."

The systems design interview went from by far my weakest interview to one of my strongest. I recommend SystemsExpert to everyone interviewing for an engineering role in a big tech company."

I wasted a week on that free content and got more confused. Luckily I saw SystemExpert's ad and risked buying the subscription. Now when I look back, that was the best decision I made. No one on the internet other than Clement can teach the basics and prepare you for what you will actually need in the interview.

I'm not the type who wants to try and memorize 500 questions in hopes that my interview questions are ones that I have seen before - I want to really understand the concepts and patterns that would help me solve ANY question. AlgoExpert and SystemsExpert do a superb job of providing in-depth explanations of the patterns and thought that you should use to arrive at the correct solution, no matter the algorithm or design problem. I put my time and trust in AlgoExpert and I now have a job at Facebook to show for it. Highly recommended!"

I ended up taking a leap, and found that the platform is beautifully designed. Everything is extremely responsive, and the experience is just fun. The videos are viciously informative, and they tell us the \"why\" in extreme detail, followed up with the \"how\" for every type of problem. Also, I lastly vouch that these questions are indeed probably the 100 most valuable questions to anyone in a SWE interview process. Thanks Clement, you're a boss."
